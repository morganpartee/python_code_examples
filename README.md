# python_code_examples
I keep writing code examples to show people stuff, and I felt like it was time to collect them. I hope the names are self explanatory. If anyone wants me to go through these examples let me know, I could throw up a youtube video about them or whatever.

**Mostly Done:**
- async scraping

**Not at all done, needs comments:**
- grid search
- kmer analysis and tokenization
